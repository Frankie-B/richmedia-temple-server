## lets get started

### Step 1
First lets setup everything, for that please go to the [documentation](https://mediamonks.github.io/generator-richmedia-temple/) from the generator. [Here](https://mediamonks.github.io/generator-richmedia-temple/)

When your done with that go to the next step.

### Step 2

Lets run build

in your package.json you would see something like

```
{
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "",
    "homepage": "",
    "author": "",
    scripts: {
        "dev": "rds-dev",
        "build": "rds-build",
        "preview": "./node_modules/.bin/henk'
    },
    license: 'ISC',
}
```

Now run 

```
npm run dev
```

this will execute rds-dev through the scripts in the package.json.

All the other steps are self explanatory just follow what is in your console.
